# Which Are Better? Blinds Or Shades?

Whether you're looking to block the sun, heat, and glare from your windows or just want something to let your San Jose home's natural light shine through, [[blinds]] and [[shades]] are both excellent options with their own benefits. A shade can protect against drafts and fading curtains and carpets but is less energy efficient than a blind. A blind blocks the sun's rays better than a shade does but won't keep things as cool as a shade in the summertime. What you choose depends on your needs.

## Blinds vs. Shades: What's the Difference?

A shade is a sheet of fabric that's attached on one side to your window and can be raised and lowered on a track. A blind is a fabric panel, usually made out of wood or plastic, that covers your window and can either be raised or lowered. Most blinds have cords on the bottom of them, but some blinds can be motorized. Blinds and shades are both great options for your windows, but the best choice really boils down to what you need from each of them. Blinds can keep rooms cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, but a shade is a better choice if you want a window treatment that camouflages itself into your home's decor.

## Blinds vs. Shades: Which Blends in Best?

A blind can blend in with your window's decor better than a shade because it's totally flat when it's down; however, there are ways you can soften both of these window treatments to make them more discreet. While the fabric on a shade is always visible, you can opt for roller shades instead of Roman shades to minimize how much you see the fabric. You can also choose which side of the shade you want to show when it's raised, making the fabric less noticeable. Blinds are available with different headrails to enhance or reduce their visibility, whether it's a simple wooden rod or something more intricate. You can also opt for blinds without a headrail, which lets you see out but doesn't advertise that you're home if your window is visible from the street. Another trick is to go with vertical blinds instead of horizontal ones. They don't block as much light, but they do make the room look more open and airier.

## Blinds & Shades: What They Cost

There's a big difference between the cost of blinds and shades. A shade is typically less expensive than a blind because it requires less material. The price for both of these options will vary depending on the size of your windows and how elaborate you want your window coverings to be. For example, total home window treatments could run you $100-$300.

## Blinds or Shades: The Bottom Line

Blinds and shades are both great options for your windows, but the best choice really boils down to what you need from each of them. Blinds can keep rooms cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, but a shade is a better choice if you want a window treatment that camouflages itself into your home's decor. You also have more options when it comes to choosing a style if you go with blinds, which can't be said for shades. Regardless of which one you choose; you're not going to regret it!
