# The Proper Way to Clean Your Draperies and Keep Them Looking Great and Going Strong

[[Draperies]] are a great window covering option for your San Jose home thanks to the beauty and longevity they boast. To continue enjoying those qualities for many years to come, educate yourself on the proper way to clean your draperies. If you're totally new to drape upkeep, keep on reading. In this article, we'll teach you all you need to know about the cleaning process.

## Know What Kind of Material Your Draperies Are Made From

There is no "one size fits all" solution to cleaning your draperies since they come in a wide assortment of materials. Here are some of the more common materials you'll run into along with the proper way to wash them:

- **Wool and cashmere** — ALWAYS dry-clean
- **Cotton** — Can be machine-washed if they are unlined
- **Silk** — Can usually be hand-washed using mild dish soap and air drying
- **Sheer curtains** — Soak in water with mild detergent, and clean them often

## Vacuum Your Draperies Once a Week

Washing your draperies is something you'll handle only once every few months or so. On a typical week, cleanup involves nothing more than a routine vacuuming. For the best results, vacuum your drapes once a week with the upholstery attachment.

## Properly Prepare Your Draperies before Cleaning

When the time comes to give your draperies a thorough cleaning, take some time to prepare them properly. Otherwise, you might wind up damaging them or even your washer and dryer. Before throwing your drapes in the wash, be sure to:

- Remove all drapery hardware from your curtains
- Check tags for machine washing instructions if applicable
- If using a cleaning product, clean an inconspicuous area before using it on the entire drapery
- Take the time to dust valances, curtain rods, and any other mounted hardware while your draperies are down
